# CheckerCab

**Important**: if you're creating a new Elixir library or service, make sure to read the Elixir project runbook in the [engineering repo](https://github.com/Shimmur/engineering/blob/main/runbooks/services/elixir_application.md).

## Creating an Elixir project

  1. Use this repository as a GitHub template when creating a new repository.

  1. Run ./replace.sh my_app MyApp (with the right application name) to replace
     all instances of the name "cookie cutter" with the right names. For
     example, ./replace abc_handler ABCHandler. The replace.sh script will
     destroy itself once it runs.
